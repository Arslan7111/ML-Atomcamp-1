This repository contains two separate machine learning projects demonstrating supervised learning techniques using real-world datasets. Both projects are implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks, with detailed markdown explanations and visualizations.

1. Multilinear & Polynomial Regression – Student Performance Dataset
Objective:
Predict students' math scores based on other exam scores and demographic information.

Tasks Covered:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Encoding categorical features
Feature engineering and polynomial feature creation
Training:
Multilinear Regression
Polynomial Regression (degree 2)
Evaluation:
RMSE, MAE, R² Score
Actual vs Predicted visualization
Discussion on overfitting in polynomial regression
Dataset: Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams

2. Naive Bayes, KNN & Decision Tree – Social Network Ads Dataset
Objective:
Objective:
Classify whether a user purchases a product based on Age and Estimated Salary.

Tasks Covered:
Data cleaning and encoding
Feature scaling (Standardization)
Training:
Gaussian Naive Bayes
K-Nearest Neighbors (k = 3, 5, 7)
Decision Tree (Gini & Entropy)
Evaluation:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
(Optional) Decision boundary visualization
Performance comparison and model analysis
Dataset: Kaggle - Social Network Ads
